This is a sample app & basic code that uses Clean Architecture & Components, that is part of a blog post 
I have written about how to architect android application using the Uncle Bob's clean architecture approach.

**NOTE** It is a relatively more complex and complete example so if you are not familiar
with [Architecture Components][arch], you are highly recommended to check other examples
in this repository first.

Introduction
-------------

### Data-Flow

### Work-Flow

### Handler-Error-Flow

#### Domain Layer
- Contains business model 
- Contains business RULEs
- Repository interface adapt 

#### Data Layer
- Implementation Repository
- Executor API data
- Storage data to local: Share preferences, database, external storage 
- Mapper data model to domain model
- Contains data service, third party data service  

#### Presentation Layer
- View (Activity/Fragment/Layout) Adapt data to view 
- Validate/Submit data input from view via UseCase

### Base Code
Base code designed one `Activity` and multiple `Fragment`, using `Navigation Component` to UI navigate
Use Hilt (2.38) for Dependencies Injection, You can easily switch to using `Koin` (I suggestion `Hilt` for big, super projects and support multiple features
/modules or dynamic)
Base code 
- Has created a flow that handles all of the corner cases, you can easily customize them via `CleanException`, it `extends Throwable`
- Added `Authorization`, `Interceptor` easily handler and `implementations` for your project if needed
- Use `ktlint`, `kotlin-offical` for check code conventions, you can run `./gradlew ktlint`
- Use `jacoco` for full Unit and Instrument test  
- Added basically `circle-ci`, `gitlab-ci` with some work-flows
- Report bugs into `Crashlytics` via `Timber.e`


### Building
Work from Android Studio 3.2 and above 

### Unit Test
You can easily write Unit Test up to 70% code coverage lines of code (LOC), if you write focus on 
- Data: API service, Local (database, share preferences), RepositoryImpl, Model Mapper 
- Domain: UseCases, Repository, Exception handlers
- Presentation: ViewModel, Model Mapper
 
### Libraries used
--------------
* [Foundation][0] - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and automated testing.
  * [AppCompat][1] - Degrade gracefully on older versions of Android.
  * [Android KTX][2] - Write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
  * [Test][4] - An Android testing framework for unit and runtime UI tests.
* [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
  * [Data Binding][11] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
  * [Lifecycles][12] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
  * [LiveData][13] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [Navigation][14] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
  * [Room][16] - Access your app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.
  * [ViewModel][17] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
     asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
  * [WorkManager][18] - Manage your Android background jobs.
* [UI][30] - Details on why and how to use UI Components in your apps - together or separate
  * [Animations & Transitions][31] - Move widgets and transition between screens.
  * [Fragment][34] - A basic unit of composable UI.
  * [Layout][35] - Lay out widgets using different algorithms.
* Third party
  * [Glide][90] for image loading
  * [Kotlin Coroutines][91] for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks
  * [ReactiveX][92] library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.
  * [Hilt][93] for dependencies injection
  * [Retrofit][94] Type-safe HTTP client for Android
  * [EasyPermission][95]  is a wrapper library to simplify basic system permissions logic when targeting Android M or higher.
